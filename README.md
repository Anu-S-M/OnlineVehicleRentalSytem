# OnlineVehicleRentalSytem
This is the first-year Summer Internship Project of my Engineering where we built a very simple, flexible easy-to-use interface for users to rent their vehicle online using Python as a programming language.
Introduction:
The Online Vehicle Rental System developed in Google Colab enables users to rent vehicles for short periods, offering an alternative to purchasing new vehicles. This system is designed to benefit users in need of temporary transportation and car dealers looking to generate additional income through rentals.

Features:
User-friendly interface for booking vehicle appointments.
Efficient record editing and updates using owner's name as a reference.
Web-based system showcasing available vehicles for rental.

Project Background:
This project was undertaken to address the limitations of traditional car rental services, which are bound by operational hours. The implementation of an online car rental system overcomes this restriction by providing 24/7 accessibility and functionality.

Prerequisites:
To execute the Online Vehicle Rental System in Google Colab, familiarity with Python programming is essential.

Objectives:
Develop a web-based platform allowing customers to register, browse vehicle options, and make reservations online. This system streamlines car rental business operations for efficient management.

How Online Car Rental Services Work:
Customers can request rental cars online by specifying rental dates and vehicle preferences. Once the details are confirmed, users provide identification during vehicle pickup. The system offers a range of car types for customers to choose from.

Benefits of Online Car Rental Services:
Flexibility and functionality of an online car rental solution.
Time-saving and user-friendly interface.
Reduced costs, paperwork, and environmental impact.
Availability 24/7, enhancing customer convenience.
Improved management efficiency for quality service delivery.
